# Hashcat

Hashcat is the self-proclaimed world's fastest and most advanced password recovery utility, supporting a vast number of hashing algorithms and attack modes, and can leverage GPUs for massive speed improvements.

## When to use it:

- When you need to crack password hashes at very high speeds.
- To leverage the power of GPUs for password cracking.
- For complex attack scenarios involving masks, rules, and hybrid attacks.
- When cracking modern or obscure hash types that other tools may not support.

## Quick usage (learning):

```bash
# Perform a dictionary attack on NTLM hashes using a GPU
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Perform a mask (brute-force) attack for an 8-digit pin (MD5 hash)
# ?d represents a digit
hashcat -m 0 -a 3 hash.txt ?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d

# Show cracked passwords
hashcat -m 1000 --show hashes.txt
```

## Common flags / options:

- `-m <id>`: Hash type code (e.g., `1000` for NTLM, `0` for MD5).
- `-a <id>`: Attack mode (`0`=Dictionary, `3`=Mask/Brute-force).
- `-O`: Enable optimized kernels for faster cracking (often on by default).
- `--show`: Display cracked passwords.
- `-r <file>`: Use a rules file.

## Authorized commands (AUTHORIZEDâ€‘ONLY):

Advanced actionable guidance requires proof of authorization.

## Defensive/detection notes:

- Like John, Hashcat is used for offline attacks, so defense focuses on prevention.
- Use strong, salted, and slow hashing algorithms (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2).
- Enforce long and complex passwords to make both dictionary and brute-force attacks impractical.
- Protect the password hashes themselves; if an attacker can't get the hashes, they can't crack them.

## Recommended lab exercise:

Using the hash from an Impacket `secretsdump` run, use Hashcat's `-m 1000` mode with `rockyou.txt` to crack a user's NTLM hash. Compare the speed to a CPU-only tool.
