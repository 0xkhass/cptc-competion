### Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and extensive standard and third-party libraries, making it a de facto language for security professionals. **When to use it:**

- To write custom security tools and scripts for automation.
- To quickly create a simple web server for exfiltrating data or serving payloads.
- To interact with APIs for reconnaissance or data gathering.
- To parse logs, manipulate data, and prototype exploits. **Quick usage (learning):**

Python

```
# Start a simple HTTP server in the current directory (great for exfil)
# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# A simple port scanner script
import socket
for port in range(1, 1025):
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    socket.setdefaulttimeout(0.1)
    if s.connect_ex(('localhost', port)) == 0:
        print(f"Port {port} is open")
    s.close()
```

**Common flags / options:**

- `-m <module>`: Run a library module as a script (e.g., `http.server`, `pip`).
- `-c "<command>"`: Execute Python code from the command line.
- `pip install <package>`: The command to install third-party libraries like `requests` or `pwntools`. **Authorized commands (AUTHORIZED‑ONLY):** Advanced actionable guidance requires proof of authorization. **Defensive/detection notes:**
- Detection focuses on the _behavior_ of the Python script, not the language itself.
- Monitor for suspicious process execution (e.g., `python -c "..."`) and network connections originating from Python processes.
- On endpoints, application control can restrict the execution of unauthorized scripts. **Recommended lab exercise:** Write a simple Python script that uses the `requests` library (`pip install requests`) to make a GET request to a website and print the status code and headers of the response. **Further reading / official docs:**
