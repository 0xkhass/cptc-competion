### BurpSuite + FoxyProxy

Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. FoxyProxy is a browser extension that simplifies switching between proxy servers. **When to use it:**

- **Burp Suite:** To intercept, inspect, and modify web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) between your browser and a web server.
- **Burp Suite:** To automate vulnerability scanning (Pro version) or perform manual testing for issues like SQLi, XSS, and broken access control.
- **Burp Suite:** To brute-force logins, discover hidden content, and manage session tokens.
- **FoxyProxy:** To quickly redirect your browser's traffic through the Burp Suite proxy without changing system-wide settings. **Quick usage (learning):**

1. Start Burp Suite and ensure the proxy listener is active (Proxy → Intercept).
2. Install FoxyProxy in Firefox or Chrome. Configure it to send traffic to Burp's listener (default: `127.0.0.1:8080`).
3. Enable the FoxyProxy profile for Burp.
4. Browse to a target web application. The traffic will appear in Burp's "Proxy → HTTP history" tab.
5. Forward interesting requests to other Burp tools like Repeater (to modify and resend) or Intruder (to automate attacks). **Common flags / options:** Burp Suite is a GUI application. Key features/tabs include:

- **Proxy:** The core interception proxy.
- **Repeater:** Manually modify and resend individual HTTP requests.
- **Intruder:** Automate customized attacks by sending many requests.
- **Decoder:** Decode/encode data (e.g., Base64, URL).
- **Comparer:** Visually compare two requests or responses. **Authorized commands (AUTHORIZED‑ONLY):** Advanced actionable guidance requires proof of authorization. **Defensive/detection notes:**
- A Web Application Firewall (WAF) can detect and block common attack payloads and scanner behavior from Burp Suite.
- Server-side monitoring can detect anomalies like a high rate of requests from one IP or repeated requests for the same page with slight variations.
- Implement robust input validation and output encoding to prevent vulnerabilities like SQLi and XSS that Burp is used to find. **Recommended lab exercise:** Set up OWASP Juice Shop. Use Burp Suite with FoxyProxy to intercept your login attempt. Send the request to Repeater, change the password, and observe the server's response. **Further reading / official docs:**
