### WhatWeb

WhatWeb identifies websites. Its goal is to answer the question, "What is that website?". It recognizes web technologies including content management systems (CMS), blogging platforms, statistic/analytics packages, JavaScript libraries, web servers, and embedded devices. **When to use it:**

- For initial reconnaissance to fingerprint a web application.
- To identify the web server, CMS, language, and frameworks in use.
- To find potential vulnerabilities based on the versions of the software it identifies.
- To quickly get an overview of the technology stack of a target website. **Quick usage (learning):**

bash

```
# Perform a basic scan on a website
whatweb example.com

# Increase the aggression level to find more information (can be noisy)
whatweb -a 3 example.com

# Scan a list of websites from a file
whatweb -i targets.txt
```

**Common flags / options:**

- `-a <level>`: Set the aggression level (1-4). Higher levels are more thorough but also more "loud".
- `-v`: Verbose output.
- `-i <file>`: Read targets from a file.
- `--log-xml=<file>`: Log output to an XML file. **Authorized commands (AUTHORIZED‑ONLY):** Advanced actionable guidance requires proof of authorization. **Defensive/detection notes:**
- Obfuscate or remove version headers and default error pages that reveal specific software versions (e.g., `X-Powered-By`).
- Use a WAF to inspect for fingerprints and block probes.
- Detection is difficult as many of WhatWeb's checks look like normal browser traffic. Monitoring for a single IP requesting many non-existent or unusual paths can be an indicator. **Recommended lab exercise:** Run WhatWeb against your favorite websites (e.g., `whatweb google.com`, `whatweb github.com`) and compare the technologies it identifies for each. **Further reading / official docs:**
