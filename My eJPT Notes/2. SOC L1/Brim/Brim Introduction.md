Brim is an open-source desktop application that processes pcap files and logs files, with a primary focus on providing search and analytics. It uses the Zeek log processing format. It also supports Zeek signatures and Suricata Rules for detection.

It can handle two types of data as an input;

- Packet Capture Files: Pcap files created with tcpdump, tshark and Wireshark like applications.
- Log Files: Structured log files like Zeek logs.
