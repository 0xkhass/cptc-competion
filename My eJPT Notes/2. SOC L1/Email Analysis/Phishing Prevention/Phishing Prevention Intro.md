There are various actions a defender can take to help protect the users from falling victim to a malicious email. 

Some examples of these actions are listed below:

- Email Security **<mark style="background: #e74c3c;">(SPF, DKIM, DMARC)</mark>**
- SPAM Filters (flags or blocks incoming emails based on reputation)
- Email Labels (alert users that an incoming email is from an outside source)
- Email Address/Domain/URL Blocking (based on reputation or explicit denylist)
- Attachment Blocking (based on the extension of the attachment)
- Attachment Sandboxing (detonating email attachments in a sandbox environment to detect malicious activity)
- Security Awareness Training (internal phishing campaigns)

Per **MITRE ATT&CK** **Framework**, [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598#mitigations) is described as an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, and contains three sub-techniques.
