**DMARC:** Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance, or DMARC, is a technical standard that helps protect email senders and recipients from spam, spoofing, and phishing.

 " _DMARC, (Domain-based  Message Authentication Reporting, & Conformance) an open source standard, uses a concept called alignment to tie the result of two other open source standards, SPF (a published list of servers that are authorized to send email on behalf of a domain) and DKIM (a tamper-evident domain seal associated with a piece of email), to the content of an email. If not already deployed, putting a DMARC record into place for your domain will give you feedback that will allow you to troubleshoot your SPF and DKIM configurations if needed._ "

## **A basic DMARC record look like?**

`v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:postmaster@website.com` 

#### **An explanation of the above record:**

- `v=DMARC1` -> Must be in all caps, and it's not optional
- `p=quarantine` -> If a check fails, then an email will be sent to the spam folder (DMARC Policy)
- `rua=mailto:postmaster@website.com` -> Aggregate reports will be sent to this email address

Refer to the DMARC resources [here](https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-record/) and [here](https://dmarc.org/overview/) for additional information on DMARC tags. Review the following resource about DMARC [Alignment](https://dmarcian.com/alignment/) .

Let's use the **Domain Health Checker** from [dmarcian.com](https://dmarcian.com/domain-checker/) and check the DMARC status of **microsoft.com**.

And the results are...

Microsoft passed all checks. We can drill down into **DMARC**, **SPF**, or **DKIM** to get more details.

In the details above, we can see that all emails that fail the DMARC check will be rejected.
