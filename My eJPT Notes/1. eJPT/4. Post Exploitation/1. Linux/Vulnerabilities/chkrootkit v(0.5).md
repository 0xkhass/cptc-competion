This thing scans our Linux system for rootkits. 


### **MSF Module to exploit:**
Chkrootkit before 0.50 will run any executable file named /tmp/update
  as root, allowing a trivial privilege escalation.

  WfsDelay is set to 24h, since this is how often a chkrootkit scan is
  scheduled by default.
