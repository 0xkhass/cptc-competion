- #### ** Defeating Windows User Account Control by abusing built-in Windows AutoElevate backdoor.**

#### User Account Access is a Windows security feature used to prevent unauthorized changes to the OS.

- A <mark style="background: #0b5345;">non-privileged user</mark> attempting to execute a program with elevated privileges will be prompted with <mark style="background: #f39c12;">UAC credential prompt</mark>.   
 whereas a <mark style="background: #239b56;">privileged user</mark> will be prompted with a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">consent prompt(Yes, No)</mark>.

- ###  **In order to elevate privileges by bypassing UAC, you will need access to a user that is a member of the local administrators group.**

#### We will use [[UACMe]] tool to elevate our privileges.... 


### **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">MSF</mark> Module:**

**`search bypassuac`**

we gonna use this memory injection technique (Only try if the user you have is in the administrators group):
To check if the user in the administrator group???

1. Go from  meterpreter session to system session: `shell`
2. Enum users: `net users`
3. Enum users in administrators group: `net localgroup administrators`
4. If you find the same user ur logged in then continue with this module.....


`exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection`
1. This module has 2 options (x86 and x64) architectures. Choose as your target architecture...
2. Choose a payload that's same as target architecture.
