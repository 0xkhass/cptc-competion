It's just a one script you need to transfer it to the target somehow... Once there open a CMD shell and now we need to enable Powershell scripts because they're disabled by default:

So go to temp folder, or create if it doesn't exist.

	powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\<Script_location> -OutputFilename <Output_file_results>


E.g.


	powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\jaws-enum.ps1 -OutputFilename JAWS-Enum.txt

This might take a couple of minutes so be patient....
