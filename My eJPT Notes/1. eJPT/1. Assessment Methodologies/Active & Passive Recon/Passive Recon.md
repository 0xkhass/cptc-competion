    WAF fingerprinting tool
    To do its magic, WAFW00F does the following:
    
	- Sends a¬†_normal_¬†HTTP request and analyses the response; this identifies a number of WAF solutions.
	- If that is not successful, it sends a number of (potentially malicious) HTTP requests and uses simple logic to deduce which WAF it is.
	- If that is also not successful, it analyses the responses previously returned and uses another simple algorithm to guess if a WAF or security solution is actively responding to our attacks.
