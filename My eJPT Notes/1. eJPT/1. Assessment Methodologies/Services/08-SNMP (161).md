## **Intro:**

- Simple Network Management Protocol is widely used for monitoring and managing networked devices, such as routers, switches, printers, servers and more.  
 

- It allows network admins to query devices for status information, configure certain settings and receive alerts or traps when specific events occur.


#### **SNMP is an Application layer protocol that uses UDP**
It involves 3 components:
- **SNMP Manager:** The system responsible for querying and interacting with SNMP agents on networked devices.
- **SNMP Agent:** Software running on networked devices that responds to SNMP queries and sends traps.
- **Management Information Base (BIS): ** A database that defines the structure of data available through SNMP. each piece of data has a OID.

### Versions of SNMP:
- **SNMPv1: ** uses community strings for authentication.
- **SNMPv2c: ** An improved version with support for bulk transfers but still relying on community strings for authentication.
- **SNMPv3: ** Introduced security features, including encryption, message integrity and user-based authentication.

#### Ports:
- **Port 161 (UDP): ** Used for SNMP queries.
- **Port 162 (UDP): ** Used for SNMP traps (notification).

## **Enumeration:**

use the `-sC` with nmap or run all snmp scripts from nmap using the wildcard *

	nmap -sU -p 161 script snmp-* <target_ip> 

- This script will show existing users on the machine that can be used for bruteforcing SMB or any other service.
## **Brute force:**

We can brute force the community strings (password for authentication) using nmap:

	nmap -sU -p 161 --script snmp-brute.nse  <ip>

## **snmpwalk tool:**

	snmpwalk -v <snmp_version> -c <community_strings_from_bruteforce> <target_ip>   

E.g.

	snmpwalk -v 1 -c public 10.6.24.81
