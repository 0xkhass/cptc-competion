The "Kiwi" module is essentially Mimikatz functionality integrated into Metasploit, allowing users to: 
- Extract NTLM password hashes
- Retrieve plaintext passwords from memory
- Perform Pass-the-Hash attacks
- Extract Kerberos tickets
- Execute Golden Ticket attacks (Kerberos ticket forgery)
- Perform other credential-related attacks

<br>
When we gain access to a Windows system through Metasploit, We can load the Kiwi module with commands like `load kiwi` and then use various Kiwi commands to extract credentials from the compromised system.

## **Usage: **

	To check for all Kiwi commands "load kiwi" then use help in meterpreter...

1. Once we have initial  access to our target inside msfconsole in a meterpreter session use kiwi: `load kiwi`
