### We can use

- ### `history` command

 to show the history of commands entered in the terminal, and if the previous user didn't clear commands history we can see it.

We can see here in the history that the user wanted to switch to root user and entered the password “chicken ”

We can clear the history with:

1. $ history -c
2. $ rm /home/kali/bash_history

### **Other method is that sometimes we can find the #ssh key on the system, then we can use it to connect to the root user**

	$ ssh root@192.168.100.15 -i <key>
