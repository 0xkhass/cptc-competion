### This tool is designed to assist in detecting security deficiencies for given Linux kernal based machine. 
#### It assesses (using heuristics methods) the exposure of the given Kernal on every publicly knows Linux kernal exploit.

## **<mark style="background: #e74c3c;">Important:</mark>**
- **you mostly need `gcc` configured on ur system or in target system to compile the exploit, 
  however sometimes you need to compile it in the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">target system</mark> due to the difference in environment**

---

### Essentially we have to download this script on our attacking machine then try to transfer it to the Target machine somehow...
- If we have a meterpreter session we can easily use upload command: `upload <path_to_les.sh>`
- Then promote from a meterpreter session to a shell session: `shell`
- Then Simply give the script x permission `chmos +x les.sh` then execute the `./les.sh` script

## **Compiling Exploits:**

- Kernel exploits need to **run in the lowest level of the OS**, which can't be done using interpreted high-level code.
- Interacting with the **kernel means no interpreter â€” raw machine instructions** are needed.
- GCC is a compiler tool that can compile exploit code written in `c` language to binary.
